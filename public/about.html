<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just a man, trying to navigate through this crazy world tech, with the hope that maybe I'll 
  be able to build something that people will love.<br />
  I'm in my 40's.  I feel that I've wasted many opportunities to just sit down and learn to code, 
  but interests flit between various different things.
  <br />
  I'm interested in so many different things, that rather than speand the time to learn one thing at a time, 
  I tend to have more focus on what will get me to my objective quicker.  My objectives change all the time.<br />
  At the moment I have a great idea for an mobile app, but ratheer than learn how to use Swift or Kotilin,
  I felt that it will be easier to build on a skill that I've dabbled in before, and expand on that, rather than 
  start a new thing.<br />
  I feel like a jack of all trades, but I'm master of none of them.  I'm pretty good at putting my hand to anything.  
  During Covid, I started studying towards my CCNA, and I was doing really well at it, but like with everything, I lose momentum,
  and then find something else.<br />
  When I said I feel like I've missed opportunites to learn to code, much of that is down to the fact that I've lost time.
  Now that I'm a parent, with a full time job with certain responsibilites, I don't have much time to sit down and learn.
  Some would say "Make time", but when you're sat in the car travelling home for an hour and a half, and then get home and 
  help put the kids to bed, and then start thinking about doing preparing dinner, then eat said dinner, and spend time with my
  wife, whilst we stare at our phones, then off to bed.  Rinse and repeat. <br/>
  I've started up running now (although that has tailed off recently), as I've noticed that the older I get,
  the fatter I get. I love food, but I've always been able to get away with packing on the pounds
  due to my excellent metabolism, but that seems to have left me.  I've also become less active, but that happens to most men of a certain age.
  You stop doing stuff.  I used to play football, hit anything with a racket, ran 800 & 1500 meter races, cross-country (not by choice).  I was fit,
  but I also smoked quite a bit.  I think my giving up smoking has played a part in my weight gain.  Fuck it, I'm going to get back into 
  my running again.  Maybe a few sit-ups and push-ups, and I'll be back in the game.
